  <b style="font-size: 35px;">TicketMaster Analysis of 2021 Concerts</b>
</div>


### Introduction {#intro}

Concerts are a crucial component of an artist's new album promotion.
Additionally, it gives fans a chance to see and hear their favorite
musicians perform live. Many fans are extremely passionate about the
artists they enjoy, and they will go to any lengths to see them perform.
Say your favorite performer just made the announcement that they will be
making a tour stop in your area. You would probably use your phone or
computer to purchase tickets, but what website would you be directed to?
Ticketmaster or Live Nation, which is owned by Ticketmaster, are the
most likely candidates. Ticketmaster is the largest global ticket
marketplace for the majority of concerts and sporting events. Two
college students who wanted to improve their theater's ticketing system
started it in 1976. The concert industry is worth 51.3 billion dollars
in 2022. Every year Ticketmaster sells nearly 500 million tickets for a
huge variety of concerts, events, and games, and every year their sites
receive more than a billion visits. By far the market leader in the live
event and ticketing space, Ticketmaster holds over 70% of the market
(and over 80% for live concerts). More commonly, Ticketmaster is
recognized for managing artists, distributing ticket-selling software,
and selling tickets. Because of the contracts, they have with sporting
and concert venues, the majority of artists are compelled to use
Ticketmaster in order to sell tickets. While Live Nation jointly owns a
sizable portion of venues, strengthening its monopoly. Through this data
analysis, we can confirm the elements that affect the minimum cost of
the concert ticket. It will be interesting to compare and contrast the
variables that affect the minimum price of the concert ticket sold by
Ticketmaster given the number of people compelled to use this platform
for the most well-known concerts. We'll be closely examining the impact
of the venue's size and population, the event's setting, the artists
performing, each artist's level of popularity, the performance day
(weekend or weekday), and the minimum price of concert tickets. The
following research questions were developed in view of all of these: 1.
Does the size and population of the venue affect the price of the
concert ticket? 2. Does the location of the event affect the price? 3.
Is the price dependent on the artist? 4. Is the pricing impacted for
each artist along with their performance date? 5. Is the mean minimum
price of Ed Sheeran the same as the mean minimum price of G-Eazy? 6. Is
the pricing of the tickets dependent on the popularity of the artist? 7.
Is the pricing impacted if the artist performed on a weekend? 8. What
factors influence the pricing of the tickets? This analysis is important
because when a global giant dominates a market, consumers feel as though
they have no other options therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be
aware of the variables that affect the minimum prices of concert tickets
sold by Ticketmaster so they can score cheaper tickets.

### About the Data

The dataset has been obtained using the oﬀicial Ticketmaster API and has
8 feature vari- ables and 1 label variable (minprice). The feature
variables include: The city in which the event is taking place, name of
the Artist, name of the Venue, Weekend or Weekday, Population of the
city, Month, Rating of the Artist and Genre of the Music the Artist is
known for.

### Exploratory Data Analysis {#eda}

The graphic representation of information and data is known as data
visualization. Data visualization tools offer an accessible way to see
and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data by utilizing
visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. Additionally, it offers a
great way for staff members or business owners to clearly present data
to non- technical audiences. To analyze vast amounts of data and make
data-driven decisions, data visualization tools and technologies are
crucial in the world of big data.

#### Visualizing Outliers

![](././images/fig34.png){fig-align="center"}

The Mean of Population of the City lies near 350,000 but it has values
ranging up to 1,600,000 which leads us to believe that there are
outliers in this feature. Since it is a universally verified data and
there are cities with Population greater than 1.5 million in the world
hence these should not be removed. There are no Outliers in the Rating
of the artist and the Mean of the Ratings lie around 84.

#### Distribution of Artist Ratings Weekend-wise

![](./images/fig35.png)In general, the artists tend to perform more on
Weekdays than on Weekends. This might be also because the Weekend
comprises of 2 days while Weekdays comprises 5.

#### Distribution of Rating of the Artist based on Month and Genre

![](./images/fig36.png)Many artists irrespective of their rating tend to
prefer performing from the months May to August (during summer break).
Majority of Hip-Hop artists have a higher rating of around 85-95 while
Country artists have a lower rating of 65-75. Rock artists are neutral
and are equally distributed throughout the rating chart.

#### Comparison of Starting Price w.r.t. Artist Score and Month

![](./images/fig37.png)As the Rating of Artists increase, the starting
price of an event reaches its peak on Weekdays while for lower artist
ratings the starting price reaches its peak on Weekends. Also, the mean
Starting price of tickets for months of January to May is higher than
other months.

#### Comparison of Artists with Starting Price

    ![](./images/fig38.png)

-   Comparison of Bottom 10 Artists with Minimum Starting Price

    ![](./images/fig39-01.png)

Genres like Hip-Hop and Metallica have the highest starting price while
R&B, Rock and Country have the lowest starting price. Also, Cities like
Seattle, Pittsburgh and Melbourne have the highest starting price while
Virginia, Springfield and New York have the lowest starting price.

#### Correlation Plot between Numeric Features

### Hypothesis Testing {#hypothesis}

Using sample data, hypothesis testing is done to determine whether a
hypothesis is plausi- ble. The test provides evidence that the
hypothesis is plausible in considering the available data. An informed
guess is first made on the parameter or distribution. The null hypoth-
esis is also known as H0, because it is the default assumption. The
opposite of what is said in the null hypothesis is then specified as an
alternative hypothesis (designated Ha). Using sample data, the
hypothesis-testing technique determines whether or not H0 may be
rejected. The statistical conclusion is that the alternative hypothesis
Ha is true if H0 is rejected. In applications involving
hypothesis-testing, the p-value offers a suitable foundation for making
conclusions. If the null hypothesis is true, the p-value serves as a
measure of how likely the sample results are; the lower the p-value, the
less likely the sample results. The null hypothesis can be disregarded
if the p-value is less than , otherwise,it cannot be rejected. The
p-value is often called the observed level of significance for the test.
Regression and correlation analysis both use hypothesis tests to assess
whether the correlation coeﬀicient and regression connection are
statistically significant.

#### T-Test

A statistical test called a t test is employed to compare the means of
two groups. It is frequently employed in hypothesis testing to establish
whether a process or treatment truly affects the population of interest
or whether two groups differ from one another. T-tests are used when the
data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances. A
t-test is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a
statistically significant difference between the means of two variables.
Calculating a t-test requires three funda- mental data values including
the difference between the mean values from each data set, the standard
deviation of each group, and the number of data values. T-tests can be
dependent or independent. The problem statement is established
mathematically by using a sample from each of the two sets in the
t-test. It assumes that the two means are equal, which is the null hy-
pothesis.Values are computed and compared to the standard values using
the formulas. Accordingly, the assumed null hypothesis is either
accepted or rejected. If the null hypoth- esis can be ruled out, it
means that the data readings are significant and almost certainly not
random.

-   When to use a t test

A t test can only be used when comparing the means of two groups. The t
test is a parametric test of difference, meaning that it makes the same
assumptions about your data as other parametric tests. The t test
assumes your data: 1. are independent 2. are (approximately) normally
distributed 3. have a similar amount of variance within each group being
compared.

-   T-test analysis on Ticket Master Data

The two performers who frequently appear in the same cities at the same
time are Ed Sheeran and G-Eazy. Thus, it was decided to compare the
minimum prices of these two artists. Here, the case study was whether Ed
Sheeran's average minimum price is higher than G- Eazy's. In a new
dataset, we only kept the information about the artists we were going to
analyze during this process and excluded all other information. Our
assumed Null Hypothesis : The mean difference of minimum price between
these two artists is zero. Alternate Hypothesis : The mean difference of
minimum price between these two artists greater than zero.
Mathematically, Let G= mean minimum price of G-Eazy and E= mean minimum
price of Ed Sheeran. Null hypothesis H0 : E− G = 0 Alternative
hypothesis Ha : E− G \> 0.

The output provides, - An explanation of what is being compared called
the "data" in the output table. - A t-value, in this case t = 5.8615 -
The degrees of freedom: 18.387. The number of "free" data points in a
test that can be used for comparisons is represented by the degrees of
freedom, which is connected to your sample size. The more degrees of
freedom we have, the more accurate the statistical analysis will be. -
The p value: 6.879e- 06 (i.e. 6.8 with 15 zeros in front). This
expresses the probability that a t value this large would occur by
chance. - A statement of the alternative hypothesis (Ha). In this test,
the Ha is that true difference in means is greater than 0. - The 95%
confidence interval. This is the range of numbers within which the true
difference in means will be 95% of the time. This can be changed from
95% to a larger or smaller value. - The mean minimum price of each
group. Since p value is less than 0.05, At 5% significance level, we
have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore there is
strong evidence that the mean minimum price of Ed Sheeran and G-Eazy
were not the same but in fact the average minimum price of Ed Sheeran
were greater than the average minimum price of G-Eazy. Bootstrapping
Mean Test: To estimate the variability in a statistic of interest,
bootstrapping involves sampling with replacement from observed data.
Bootstrapping is a statistical technique that generates several
simulated samples from a single dataset. With this method, standard
errors, confi- dence intervals, and hypothesis testing can all be
calculated. The bootstrap is frequently used to evaluate the precision
of an estimate based on a sample of data from a larger population.
Consider the sample mean. Drawing numerous different sample means is the
most effective technique to learn how they behave. One method of
resampling is to generate a proxy universe based solely on our sample by
repeatedly replicating the sample data. Since the sample typically
contains all the information we have about the population that gave rise
to it, it is sometimes the best place to begin when building an
artificial proxy universe from which we can extract resamples and study
the distribution of the statistic of interest. In this case, we
replicated our data 10000 times to check the results, the mean ratio was
found from bootstrap G-Eazy and Bootstrap Ed Sheeran and we calculated
the 95% confi- dence interval for the difference between the average
means of these two artists and obtained the results that at 95%
bootstrap percentile interval,mean ratio of G-Eazy's minimum price to Ed
Sheeran's minimum price is between 0.7332200 and 0.8629818.

![](./images/fig42.png)At 95% bootstrap percentile interval,mean ratio of
G-Eazy's minimum price to Ed Sheeran's minimum price is between
0.7332200 and 0.8629818.

#### Chi-Square Test:

Whether there is a statistically significant association between
categorical variables is determined by the Chi-square test of
independence. Is there a relationship between the values of one category
variable and the values of other categorical variables? This is answered
by a hypothesis test. Chi-square test has two hypothesis; Null
hypothesis : The categorical variables do not have any relationships
with one another. Knowing the value of one variable does not make it
easier to predict the value of another. Alternate hypothesis : The
category variables are related to one another. It does make it easier to
predict the value of another variable if you are aware of the value of
one. A p-value for a Chi-square test below or equal to the significance
level means there is enough data to draw the conclusion that the
observed distribution differs from the expected distribution. It is
clear that there is a connection between the categorical variables.

-   Chi-square test analysis on Ticket Master Data We considered two
    categorical variables 'Artist' and 'City' to find the correlation
    between them. We stated the hypothesis; Null Hypothesis H0 : The
    variables artist and city are independent to each other Alternate
    Hypothesis Ha : The variables artist and city are not independent to
    each other. From the output we see that the p-value is less than the
    significance level of 5%. If the p-value is less than the
    significance level, we can reject the null hypothesis. In our
    context, rejecting the null hypothesis for the Chi-square test of
    independence means that there is a significant relationship between
    the Artist and the city. Yates Continuity Correction: This Chi
    square test assumes that the continuous Chi-Square distribution may
    adequately approximate the discrete probability of the frequencies
    in a contingency table. The test statistic that results is typically
    skewed upwards because this assumption is prone to being a little
    inaccurate. To correct for this bias we can apply Yate's continuity
    correction, which applies the follow- ing correction to the X2
    formula: X2 = Σ(\|Oi-Ei\| -- 0.5)2 / Ei where O is the observed
    value, E is the expected value and Σ is the sum value.

According to the test, the p value that corresponds to the test is p =
0.002999, which is less than 5% significant value, so we can reject the
null hypothesis.

#### ANOVA Test

-   One Way ANOVA:

When testing an hypothesis with a categorical explanatory variable and a
quantitative response variable, the tool normally used in statistics is
Analysis of Variances, also called ANOVA. We are performing an ANOVA
test using the R programming language, to a dataset of ticketmaster
minimum price across artists. The objective of the ANOVA test is to
analyse if there is a (statistically) significant difference in minimum
price of the concert tickets, between different artists. In other words,
I am interested to see whether minimum price of concert tickets are more
likely to change with the artists' performing. The Hypothesis is: Null
Hypothesis: There is no effect of the Artist on the Minimum Price.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is an effect of the Artist on the Minimum
Price. Here the artists are the explanatory variable and minimum price
is the response variable.

We can see that, our F value is 17.48, and p-value is very low too. In
other words, the variation of minimum price of tickets means among
different artists is much larger than the variation of minimum price of
tickets within each artist performing, and our p-value is less than
0.05, Hence we reject the null hypothesis H0 and can conclude that there
is a significant relationship between artists and minimum price of
concert tickets.

-   Two Way ANOVA:

The two-way ANOVA test is used to simultaneously compare the effects of
two grouping variables on a response variable at the same time. The
objective of the ANOVA test is to analyse if there is a (statistically)
significant difference in minimum price of the concert tickets, between
different cities and different days (i.e. weekend or weekday). In other
words, we are interested to see whether minimum price of concert tickets
are more likely to change with the cities and weekends. The Hypothesis
is: Null Hypothesis: There is no effect of the City and Weekend on the
Minimum Price. Alternative Hypothesis: There is an effect of the City
and Weekend on the Minimum Price. Here the city and weekend are the
explanatory variable and minimum price is the response variable.

We can see that, my F value is 3.92 for weekend and 3.25 for city, and
p-value is very low too. In other words, the variation of minimum price
of tickets means among different cities and different days is much
larger than the variation of minimum price of tickets within each city
and weekend or weekday performances. The p-value is less than 0.05,
Hence we reject the null hypothesis H0 and can conclude that there is a
significant relationship between cities and weekends to the minimum
price of concert tickets. We go ahead to check if you think these two
variables will interact to create a synergistic effect. Here, we can see
that city, weekend and their interaction effect are all significant
since their p-values are less than 0.05 and can conclude that there is a
significant relationship between cities, weekends and their interaction
effect to the minimum price of concert tickets.

### Linear Regression {#linear}

-   A fundamental and widely used form of predictive analysis is linear
    regression. Re- gression analysis' main goal is to look at two
    things:

1.  Is it possible to accurately predict an outcome (dependent) variable
    using a set of predictor variables?
2.  Which particular variables---as shown by the size and sign of the
    beta estimates--- are highly significant predictors of the outcome
    variable, and how do they affect the outcome variable?

-   The relationship between one dependent variable and one or more
    independent vari- ables is explained using these regression
    estimates. The following formula represents the regression
    equation's most basic version with one dependent variable and one
    independent variable:

Y = 𝛼 + 𝛽1(X1) + 𝛽2(X2) + + 𝛽𝑛(Xn) where Y = Estimated Dependent
Variable Score, Alpha = Intercept, Beta = Regression Coeﬀicient, and X =
Score of the Independent Variable.

Three major uses for regression analysis are: 1. Determining the
strength of predictors 2. Forecasting an effect 3. Trend forecasting

Types of Linear Regression: 1. Simple linear regression: 1 dependent
variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio
or dichotomous) 2. Multiple linear regression: 1 dependent variable
(interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or
dichotomous) 3. Logistic regression: 1 dependent variable (dichotomous),
2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous) 4. Ordinal
regression: 1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable(s)
(nom- inal or dichotomous) 5. Multinomial regression: 1 dependent
variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or
dichotomous) 6. Discriminant analysis: 1 dependent variable (nominal),
1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)

##### Model 1

Firstly we fit all our independent variables to check which features are
infact the most significant i.e., have the most effect on our dependent
variable (minprice). The formula for this fit can be given as: minprice
= 𝛼 + 𝛽1(city) + 𝛽2(artist) + 𝛽3(venue) +𝛽4(weekend) + 𝛽5(pop) +
𝛽6(month) + 𝛽7(score) +𝛽8(genre) + 𝜖

![](./images/fig43.png){fig-align="center"}

Seeing the summary statistics of our first fit we can conclude that *the
Artist*, *Venue of the Event*, *Population of the city the event is in*
and *the Rating of the Artist* are the main features that help
predicting the Starting price of and event.

##### Model 2

From the previous model we fit the model again with our top 4 features:
*the Artist*, *Venue of the Event*, *Population of the city the event is
in* and *the Rating of the Artist*. The formula for this fit can be
given as:

minprice = 𝛼 + 𝛽1(artist) + 𝛽2(venue) + 𝛽3(pop)  + 𝛽4(score) + 𝜖

![](./images/fig44.png){fig-align="center"}

There is not a lot of difference between the first and second fit models
in Adjusted R- Squared values. Hence more complex models need to be
applied on this data to get better results.

##### Model 3

A quadratic regression is the process of finding the equation of the
parabola that best fits a set of data. The formula for this fit can be
given as:

minprice = 𝛼 + 𝛽1(artist) + 𝛽2(artist2) + 𝛽3(venue) +𝛽4(venue2) +
𝛽5(pop) + 𝛽6(pop2) + 𝛽7(score) + 𝛽8(score2) + 𝜖

![](./images/fig45.png){fig-align="center"}

The Quadratic Regression model increased the Adjusted R-Squared slightly
from the pre- vious two models.

##### Model 4

As a special case of multiple linear regression, polynomial regression
is a type of linear regression that estimates the relationship as an nth
degree polynomial. The formula for this fit can be given as:

minprice = 𝛼 + 𝛽1(artist) + 𝛽2(artist2) + 𝛽3(artist3) + 𝛽4(artist4) +
𝛽5(artist5) + 𝛽6(venue) + 𝛽7(venue2) +𝛽8(venue3) + 𝛽9(venue4) +
𝛽10(venue5) + 𝛽11(pop) + 𝛽12(pop2) + 𝛽13(pop3) + 𝛽14(pop4) + 𝛽15(pop5)
+𝛽16(score) + 𝛽17(score2) + 𝛽18(score3) + 𝛽19(score4) + 𝛽20(score5) + 𝜖

![](./images/fig46.png){fig-align="center"}

From the graphs we can see that there are number of outliers present in
our data but even so our Adjusted R-Squared value has increased
significantly from the previous 3 models.

##### Checking for Outliers

![](./images/fig47-01.png){fig-align="center"}

The Polynomial model has some outliers. After checking these values from
our original dataframe we can confirm that these are infact outliers and
must be removed. One of the examples of the outliers is Outlier number
423 which has minimum price has 1\$ as the starting price of the event
even though the Artist of the event is top tier and has a very high
rating.

##### Model 5

Polynomial Regression is sensitive to outliers so the presence of one or
two outliers can also badly affect the performance. Hence we remove
these outliers using Cook's Distance. A general rule of thumb is to
investigate any point that is more than 4x the mean of all the
distances. The formula for this fit is the same our previous model since
the model parameter is not changing only outliers are being removed.

![](./images/fig48.png){fig-align="center"}

Removing outliers has increased the model's Adjusted R-Squared even
though the model's parameters have not been changed.

### Summary of Evaluation of models{#results}

![](./images/fig49.png){fig-align="center"}

After comparing all the models, the Polynomial Model without Outliers
has the highest Adjusted R-Squared, hence we choose that model as our
best model.

### Conclusion{#conclusion}

In the analysis of concert data, several key insights have been uncovered. Firstly, it's observed that many artists, regardless of their rating, tend to favor performing during the summer months of May to August. Secondly, there is a notable distinction in rating distribution among music genres, with Hip-Hop artists generally receiving higher ratings (around 85-95), while Country artists tend to have lower ratings (65-75), and Rock artists display a more evenly distributed rating range. Additionally, findings reveal variations in starting prices between different genres and cities, with Hip-Hop and Metallica concerts having the highest starting prices, and cities like Seattle, Pittsburgh, and Melbourne commanding higher starting prices. Furthermore, statistical tests suggest dependencies between variables such as minimum price and artist score, as well as the influence of the artist and city-weekend combinations on minimum price prediction. While certain variables like artist, venue, city population, and artist rating hold significance in predicting starting prices, it is acknowledged that the dataset's randomness and the absence of comprehensive historical data may necessitate the inclusion of additional factors for more accurate price predictions in concert planning.
